                The Jacksonville Linux Users Group primary domain name from its inception in 1996 through 2023 was
                JaxLUG.org. This domain name has been lost. <a href="jaxlug_org.html">Another page</a> covers the story
                of how that happened. This page covers the story on how JaxLUG.net came about.
            </p>
            <p>
                JaxLUG.net has never been an official domain, it was registered in bad-faith!

                To begin for context, here is a <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=131068652222104&w=2">message</a>
                from William L. Thomson Jr. to the group announcing he would be stepping down from various roles with the
                JaxLUG in 2011. This is covered in more detail in the
                <a href="jaxlug_org.html">story of how JaxLUG.org was lost</a>,
                and years later in 2013, William was still stuck providing various services. Rather than cooperate to
                migrate services in a reliable way, without data loss, loss of wiki, and especially, loss of JaxLUG.org
                domain name, some in the group had other ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                To some in the group, their need for control outweighed reliability and the groups reputation, not to
                mention basic fiduciary duty to protect the groups data, wiki, and assets like JaxLUG.org domain name.
                These actions were never taken with full support, public discussion, voting, etc. None of these actions
                were ever fully authorized, as the group was unofficial, so anyone can pretty much do anything as has
                been the case for far to many years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many actions taken to benefit the group, in turn caused considerable harm, years of problems, and things
                that are just not becoming of such a technical group, and surely not Linux!
            </p>
            <h2 id="coup_d_etat">Coup d'&eacute;tat</h2>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/jaxlug_org/email_w_jess_2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of William Email with Jess 2" height="360" style="float: left; padding: 0 1em 0 0;">
            <p>
                On July 17th, 2013 the unofficial JaxLUG had a meeting where unofficial elections without any records
                took place in person. The results of which were announced in this
                <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=137452510824301&w=2">message</a> from Gene Cronk regarding
                new unofficial officers and other changes... This was announcing abandonment of JaxLUG.org, creation
                of a new wiki under JaxLUG.net domain name, and migrating to Google Groups, which was previous suggested
                by William.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was primarily due to the groups inability to host the mailing list, why they move to Google Groups,
                and despite the comment, no one was seeking to get off the old mailing list, it was to cover the fact
                no one could host it. This is quite strange, as for a Linux group, anyone can learn to setup and
                administrate a mail server. That nobody in the group has such ability or knowledge, is simply due to a
                lack of will.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than cooperate, renew JaxLUG.org domain name, take the entire JaxLUG VM with Wiki, data, and 
                the JaxLUG mail server including the JaxLUG mailing list, a Coup d'&eacute;tat occurred, a new domain
                JaxLUG.net was acquired, unofficially, without any public group discussion, no discussion on mailing
                list, the creation of a new Wiki, and migration to Google Groups.
            </p>

            <p>
                This change was a monumental one, for the first time since 1996, the Jacksonville Linux Users Group,
                JaxLUG, would no longer have a self-hosted mailing list under JaxLUG.org, list@jaxlug.org, as reflected
                by the
                <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list">end of the JaxLUG mailing list archive on Marc.info</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jaxlug/c/I2ofiaL7sSM">message</a> from Jess Hires went
                out on the new mailing list on Google Groups, and the rest is history. While on the surface this might
                seem like a good, host-less, administration-less approach, it was a fundamental change in the group and
                rather than increasing abilities, reflected further loss and decay of the groups skillset. Also, this
                had no association with JaxLUG.net, it would take years before Jess Hires made such a suggestion,
                list.jaxlug.net, in this <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jaxlug/c/I-NIBBdCO1s">message</a> years
                later in 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
                This brought about immediate confusion in 2013 as stated in this
                <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jaxlug/c/OVmENcQ8RL4">message</a> from Alex Kaplan who also asked
                about JaxLUG.org going offline. JaxLUG.org DNS record was updated to point to the new wiki under
                JaxLUG.net, and domain renewed until takeover in 2017. JaxLUG.org domain name was never abandoned, and
                control of that domain name was transferred in 2017, and lost in 2023... Also as Alex mentioned later on
                in that <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jaxlug/c/OVmENcQ8RL4/m/1NySoD0yWZgJ">message</a>, the
                begging of the mess as the new Wiki was being spammed, just as the old one was, a problem William dealt
                with years prior, not occurring in old wiki on JaxLUG.org, among many issues to come with the wiki,
                like missing data that Alex was looking for! Spam continued to be an issue per this
                <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jaxlug/c/FWg9A5IHLDo/m/R7_mu9d6uegJ">message</a> from Jess Hires.

            <p>
                Now, this section is hard to track accurately and needs to be updated for accuracy, filling in various
                details, like who hosted the initial wiki under JaxLUG.net. The data on that wiki was entered from
                scratch, it was not a wiki based on the one hosted under JaxLUG.org, it was not a copy, a backup, etc.
                It was being manually recreated, as part of the groups efforts to subvert others, as evident
                by this <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jaxlug/c/QBE--VbY-nk">message</a> from Jess Hires regarding
                backfilling the wiki. Ever since then, there has been non-stop issues with the wiki, and loss of data
                at least one other time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This likely does not cover all, but just to speed through it, the wiki on JaxLUG.net had issues on:

                At one point, Dan Bidleman in 2021 was trying to get William L Thomson to help administrate the JaxLUG
                server, created an account, and provided a link to the server at JaxLUG.org...

            <p>
                Ever since the 2013 Coup d'&eacute;tat, the JaxLUG.net wikis have had various issues. Despite years of
                reliable hosting, no loss of data, and other things that JaxLUG.org was plagued with in the past, prior
                to William L. Thomson Jr. unwanted take over of hosting the wiki, and other services. The wikis hosted
                under JaxLUG.net have had various issues, that continue to this very day. There was interest in pointing
                JaxLUG.net to this Github hosted Website, as was suggested by William in this
                <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jaxlug/c/-ac6jLRY8WY">message</a> in 2017, to abandon self-hosted
                wiki, this was realized in 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2024  Ramon Dominguez opened a ticket on the JaxLUG Github account, which William L. Thomson Jr.
                responded to, with William having created the account on Github for JaxLUG years prior, per his past
                message to the group. Ramon proceeded with creating the foundation to what is this website, as the
                future reliable home, to end the Wiki mess of years past, and to ideally, finally, get others within
                the group to collaborator as few if any ever have on any past or present JaxLUG Wiki.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, this is a further loss of skillset, as it is trivial to setup a webserver with Linux, and anyone
                should be able to setup and administration a Wiki using Linux, this like a mail server is something that
                anyone can do given the will. Though reliable hosting can be difficult, as the group has found out the
                hard way, and the some in the group lack respect for what it takes to keep things up and running and
                not lose data.
            </p>
            <h2 id="losing">Losing JaxLUG.net</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Just like JaxLUG.org was lost, in 2024 they almost lost JaxLUG.net per this
                <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jaxlug/c/nlyViNcByBY">message</a> from Robert Mckennon. In 2025,
                Christian McLaughlin spent several weeks trying to get access to the JaxLUG.net DNS account. The
                problems of the past remain, and JaxLUG.net has never resolve any issue, and only created even more
                issues. At some point this domain maybe acquired by the official Jacksonville Linux Users Group, Inc..
            </p>
            <p>
                JaxLUG.net has never been the official domain, and its entire lifespan has been plagued with issues!
