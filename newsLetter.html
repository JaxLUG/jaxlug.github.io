            </div>
            	<p>The latest iteration of the virtual machine manager not only adds initial support for kernel 6.17, 
					but it also improves the Linux Guest Additions support for both Oracle Linux and RHEL 10 guests, as well as Windows 11/ARM guests.</p>
            	<p>VirtualBox 7.2 also brings improvement to the vboxvideo kernel module for Linux guests. On top of that, you get the enabling of video decoding acceleration for Linux hosts (when the 3D option is used). 
					It also fixes a swapped scan code issue and a VBoxClient start failure for Linux kernels older than 2.6.</p>

              </div>
        	  <p>Git, a distributed version control system and cornerstone tool in software development that helps developers efficiently manage changes in their code across projects, 
				  has just released its new 2.51 version.</p>				
              <p>A major focus is on multi-pack indexes (MIDX). Git now supports cruft-free MIDX repacks with a new option, “repack.MIDXMustContainCruft,” which ensures cruft packs are always included when rewriting packfiles. 
				  This makes repacks smaller and more efficient while keeping repository data consistent.</p>
		      <p>The release also debuts a “path-walk” method for pack creation. Instead of selecting objects using the previous reachability walk, this new approach produces leaner packfiles by walking trees by path, 
				  cutting down both size and repack time—an improvement especially noticeable in repositories with extensive histories.</p>

        	</div>
        	   <p>August 25, 1991 marks an important date for Linux and open-source enthusiasts, because that's the day Linus Torvalds posted to the comp.os.minix newsgroup (remember newsgroups?) 
				  the following message:<br>
				   “Hello everyone out there using minix –
				   “I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.”
			   </p>
		    <p>The message continued with, "This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready.  I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, 
				as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things)." <br>
				The first release, version 0.01, was officially released in September of the same year and included just over 10 thousand lines of code. 
				In comparison, the current Linux kernel has surpassed over 40 million lines of code.

        			<p><span class="headline hl4">LinuxIAC by B. Borisov</span></p>
        		</div>
        			<p>The 30-year-old ext2 filesystem is marked as deprecated in the upcoming Linux kernel 6.9 for lacking dates support beyond 2038.</p>
					
					<p>Over the past three decades, ext2 has been an integral part of every Linux kernel version, serving as the go-to filesystem for Linux 
						distributions until the turn of the millennium, around 2002-2003.

						</figure>
						
					<p>However, like all technologies, ext2 has reached its twilight, giving way to newer, more advanced alternatives, in that case in the face of the ext3 file system. 
						The transition from ext2 as the default filesystem to more advanced filesystems like ext3 happened at different times for various Linux distributions.
