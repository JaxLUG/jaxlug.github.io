 		           	“Since civilization began, aggression has been useful in as much as it has definite survival advantages,”

					  	"Now, however, technology has advanced at such a pace that this aggression may destroy us all by nuclear or biological war," 
					  	he continued. "We need to control this inherited instinct by our logic and reason. We need to be quicker to identify such threats and act before they get out of control."<br>
                 	What's the solution then? The answer might surprise you:
						"This might mean some form of world government. But that might become a tyranny. All this may sound a bit doom-laden but I am an optimist. <br>
						I think the human race will rise to meet these challenges.”
						You call it optimism? <br>

            	Cockpit is an interesting project for web-based Linux administration that has received relatively little attention over the years.</p>

	            <p>Part of that may be due to the project's strategy of minor releases roughly every two weeks, rather than larger releases with many new features. 
	            	While the strategy has done little to garner headlines, it has delivered a useful and extensible tool to observe, manage, and troubleshoot Linux servers.</p>

        			<p><span class="headline hl4">J. Davis - September 17, 2023 </span></p>
        		</div>
        			Today marks the 32nd anniversary of Linus Torvalds introducing the inaugural Linux 0.01 kernel version, and celebrating this milestone, 
        			Torvalds has launched the Linux 6.6-rc2. Among the noteworthy updates are the inclusion of a feature catering to the ASUS ROG Flow X16 tablet's mode handling and 
        			the renaming of the new GenPD subsystem to pmdomain</p>
						
            <p>The Linux 6.6 edition is progressing well, brimming with exciting new features that promise to enhance user experience. 
            	Early benchmarks are indicating promising results, especially on high-core-count servers, pointing to a potentially robust and efficient update in the Linux series.<br>
					Here is what Linus Torvalds had to say in today's announcement: 
            	<span class="citation">"Another week, another -rc."</span> 
            	I think the most notable thing about 6.6-rc2 is simply that it's exactly 32 years to the day since the 0.01 release. 
            	And that's a round number if you are a computer person.<br>

        			<p>Well version 29.3 of the Emacs editor has been released: <br> 
        				Emacs 29.3 is an emergency bugfix release; it includes no new features except a small number of changes intended to resolve security vulnerabilities 
        				uncovered in Emacs 29.2. <br> 
        				Those vulnerabilities mostly have to do with executing untrusted Lisp code; see the the
        				<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS?h=emacs-29#n46">the NEWS file</a> for a bit more information.

        			<p><span class="headline hl4">LinuxIAC by B. Borisov</span></p>
        		</div>
        			<p>The 30-year-old ext2 filesystem is marked as deprecated in the upcoming Linux kernel 6.9 for lacking dates support beyond 2038.</p>
					
					<p>Over the past three decades, ext2 has been an integral part of every Linux kernel version, serving as the go-to filesystem for Linux 
						distributions until the turn of the millennium, around 2002-2003.

						</figure>
						
					<p>However, like all technologies, ext2 has reached its twilight, giving way to newer, more advanced alternatives, in that case in the face of the ext3 file system. 
						The transition from ext2 as the default filesystem to more advanced filesystems like ext3 happened at different times for various Linux distributions.
