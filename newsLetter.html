            	<p>Ubuntu 24.04.1 means "Jammy Jellyfish," users will be offered an update. The "Noble Numbat" came out Friday,

            	<p>Canonical says that it's time to update your desktop – but the fact that you can does not of course mean that you should just yet. Errors can slip through unnoticed; 
		   for example, we note that the "press release" link on that page is broken. If you're not in a hurry, 
		   postpone the upgrade for a week or two. 22.04 remains fully supported until April 2027s.</p>

        	</div>
        		<p>The release’s highlight is the hardened security settings for “valid users,” “invalid users,” “read list,” and “write list.” In the past, 
			  unresolved user or group names would be skipped without any notification, potentially leading to insecure access permissions</p>
						
            		<p>With this update, any issues in name resolution due to communication errors with a domain controller will now trigger an error log, and the connection attempt will be denied, 
			   thereby preventing unintended access. Now support LDAP TLS/SASL channel binding, a critical security feature with modern cybersecurity practices. 
			  This enhancements enables SASL binds over TLS connections, fortifying the authentication process.</p>
		        <p> The release debuts new features and improvements, such as automatic keytab updates following machine password changes, enhancing the seamless operation of network services 
			   that rely on Samba for authentication. New DNS hostname configuration options to improve the integration of Samba within Active Directory environments, 
			    aiding in smoother domain joins and service registrations.</p>

        			<p>Well version 29.3 of the Emacs editor has been released: <br> 
        				Emacs 29.3 is an emergency bugfix release; it includes no new features except a small number of changes intended to resolve security vulnerabilities 
        				uncovered in Emacs 29.2. <br> 
        				Those vulnerabilities mostly have to do with executing untrusted Lisp code; see the the
        				<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS?h=emacs-29#n46">the NEWS file</a> for a bit more information.

        		</div>
        			<p>The 30-year-old ext2 filesystem is marked as deprecated in the upcoming Linux kernel 6.9 for lacking dates support beyond 2038.</p>
					
					<p>Over the past three decades, ext2 has been an integral part of every Linux kernel version, serving as the go-to filesystem for Linux 
						distributions until the turn of the millennium, around 2002-2003.

								<figcaption class="figcaption">"good by old fiend. may the force be with you."</figcaption>
						</figure>
						
					<p>However, like all technologies, ext2 has reached its twilight, giving way to newer, more advanced alternatives, in that case in the face of the ext3 file system. 
						The transition from ext2 as the default filesystem to more advanced filesystems like ext3 happened at different times for various Linux distributions.
