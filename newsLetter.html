            </div>
            	<p>The latest iteration of the virtual machine manager not only adds initial support for kernel 6.17, 
					but it also improves the Linux Guest Additions support for both Oracle Linux and RHEL 10 guests, as well as Windows 11/ARM guests.</p>
            	<p>VirtualBox 7.2 also brings improvement to the vboxvideo kernel module for Linux guests. On top of that, you get the enabling of video decoding acceleration for Linux hosts (when the 3D option is used). 
					It also fixes a swapped scan code issue and a VBoxClient start failure for Linux kernels older than 2.6.</p>

              </div>
        	  <p>The release’s highlight is the hardened security settings for “valid users,” “invalid users,” “read list,” and “write list.” In the past, 
		          unresolved user or group names would be skipped without any notification, potentially leading to insecure access permissions</p>
						
              <p>With this update, any issues in name resolution due to communication errors with a domain controller will now trigger an error log, and the connection attempt will be denied, 
		         thereby preventing unintended access. Now support LDAP TLS/SASL channel binding, a critical security feature with modern cybersecurity practices. 
		         This enhancements enables SASL binds over TLS connections, fortifying the authentication process.</p>
		      <p> The release debuts new features and improvements, such as automatic keytab updates following machine password changes, enhancing the seamless operation of network services 
		         that rely on Samba for authentication. New DNS hostname configuration options to improve the integration of Samba within Active Directory environments, 
		         aiding in smoother domain joins and service registrations.</p>

        	    <span class="headline hl3">Happy 33rd Birthday, Linux!</span>
        		<p><span class="headline hl4">9to5Linux, Nestor M., SEP 2024</span></p>
        	</div>
        	   <p> August 25th 2024 Linux turned 33 years old. Grab a glass of your favorite beverage and celebrating the 33rd birthday of Linux!
			   On August 25th, 1991, the 21-year-old Finnish student Linus Benedict Torvalds made his now-famous announcement on the comp.os.minix 
			   newsgroup that he’s working on a free operating system for 386(486) AT clones, just as a “hobby.” </p>
		    <p> That’s right, it’s been 33 years since he made that announcement and he probably never dreamed that the so-called “hobby” would turn into something huge, 
			    used by millions of computer users around the globe. Today, Linux is everywhere around us, from Android smartphones, Wi-Fi routers, smart assistants, and smart fridges, 
			    to big-screen TVs, satellites, and airplanes. Linux even powers the entire Internet, the world’s top 500 supercomputers, the Wall Street, and even the ISS (International Space Station).
			     Even if you don’t use it or you don’t see it, Linux is there, in your home, believe that. 
			    I also like to remind you that the phrase “this is the year of Linux” is irrelevant today because Linux has been in our lives for 33 years.

        			<span class="headline hl1">Ext2 Filesystem Ends</span>
        			<p><span class="headline hl4">LinuxIAC by B. Borisov</span></p>
        		</div>
        			<p>The 30-year-old ext2 filesystem is marked as deprecated in the upcoming Linux kernel 6.9 for lacking dates support beyond 2038.</p>
					
					<p>Over the past three decades, ext2 has been an integral part of every Linux kernel version, serving as the go-to filesystem for Linux 
						distributions until the turn of the millennium, around 2002-2003.

								<figcaption class="figcaption">"good by old fiend. may the force be with you."</figcaption>
						</figure>
						
					<p>However, like all technologies, ext2 has reached its twilight, giving way to newer, more advanced alternatives, in that case in the face of the ext3 file system. 
						The transition from ext2 as the default filesystem to more advanced filesystems like ext3 happened at different times for various Linux distributions.
