            the money will be used for administrative purposes, legal filings, trademark, domain, etc. In the future,

            Jacksonville Florida Metropolitan area to foster the education and usage of Linux!

	<h2><span class="headline" id="Meetings">JaxLUG Meetings</span></h2>
		<hr>  
		<p>
            At this time, official Jacksonville Linux Users' Group™, JaxLUG™, meetings are on hold until we secure a
            permanent meeting location for 2026 and beyond and/or elect to stop meeting in person and just meet
            virtually for maximum accessibility. This will be discussed by members. Hopefully, presentations will
            resume in January, or as soon as a location is secured and presenters lined up!
        </p>
		<p>
            We will be looking to fill the 2026 calendar with presentations as much in advanced as possible!
		</p>

	 	<p>
           We welcome and encourage anyone, be it local, outsider, hobbyist, professional, student, or other Linux 
           enthusiast, to be a presenter at any of our monthly meetings, with a topic of their choosing, or one the group
           has requested. Simply provide a Title and a Synopsis of the presentation to a board member or officer of the
           JaxLUG, at this time, we will be working on other ways to formalize the presentation application process.
		   Please, provide at least one month notice for us to confirm and add the presentation Title and Synopsis
           to our calendar.
        </p>
		<p>
           For students, this is a great way to meet state requirements on public presentations and looks better on your
           resume than in-class presentations. Students are HIGHLY encouraged to present!
