            At this time, official Jacksonville Linux Users' Group™, JaxLUG™, meetings are on hold until we secure a
            permanent meeting location for 2026 and beyond and/or elect to stop meeting in person and just meet
            virtually for maximum accessibility. This will be discussed by members. Hopefully, presentations will
            resume in January, or as soon as a location is secured and presenters lined up!
        </p>

            We will be looking to fill the 2026 calendar with presentations as much in advanced as possible!
