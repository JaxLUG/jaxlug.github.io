            Now that Jacksonville Linux Users Group is a Florida Non-Profit, 501(c)(3) under IRC, which will take 5 years
            to receive permanent status from the IRS, but, in the mean time, anyone can now do tax deductible
            donations to the JaxLUG! We are working on setting up ways for you to donate. For the immediate time being
            the money will be used for administrative purposes, legal filings, trademark, domain, etc. In the future,
            as the JaxLUG's resources grow these funds will be put to use by the JaxLUG board to benefit the
            Jacksonville Florida Metropolitan area to foster the education and usage of Linux!
        </p>
		<p>
            Presently, we are looking into donation platforms and will provide links ASAP, stay tuned!

            At this time, official Jacksonville Linux Users' Group™, JaxLUG™, meetings are on hold until we secure a
            permanent meeting location for 2026 and beyond and/or elect to stop meeting in person and just meet
            virtually for maximum accessibility. This will be discussed by members. Hopefully, presentations will
            resume in January, or as soon as a location is secured and presenters lined up!
        </p>
		<p>
            We will be looking to fill the 2026 calendar with presentations as much in advanced as possible!

	 	<p>
           We welcome and encourage anyone, be it local, outsider, hobbyist, professional, student, or other Linux 
           enthusiast, to be a presenter at any of our monthly meetings, with a topic of their choosing, or one the group
           has requested. Simply provide a Title and a Synopsis of the presentation to a board member or officer of the
           JaxLUG, at this time, we will be working on other ways to formalize the presentation application process.
		   Please, provide at least one month notice for us to confirm and add the presentation Title and Synopsis
           to our calendar.
        </p>
		<p>
           For students, this is a great way to meet state requirements on public presentations and looks better on your
           resume than in-class presentations. Students are HIGHLY encouraged to present!

            Official Jacksonville Linux Users Group, JaxLUG, meetings are suspended as of September 2025. Another
            informal group may elect to meet, but that group should not be confused with the Jacksonville Linux Users
            Group, Inc. dba JaxLUG.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please do not confuse the two groups, the JaxLUG has legal status, the other one does not exist legally!
        </p>
        <p>
            Official meetings will resume again in 2026, and will be announced towards the end of 2025. Stay tuned!

            The JaxLUG has a long history, and history must be learned from or it will be repeated. While the JaxLUG
            has survived for going on four decades, it is not without controversy and issues that are the motivation
            and reasoning behind the recent legal changes and forthcoming structural changes. To learn about how the
            JaxLUG got here, we are creating some pages to cover some of the pivotal moments in the JaxLUG history.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aim to cover the good not just the controversial, and please feel free to open issues with any suggestions
            and/or corrections.
