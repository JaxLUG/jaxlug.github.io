                The Jacksonville Linux Users Group Inc. has a number of open legal positions as we work towards proper
                legal structure and long term stewardship. The process to obtain 501(c)(3) status is a 5-year
                probationary, one-time, one-chance, process and any issues in this process means loss of status for good.
                This happened to Gentoo Linux, which
                <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Foundation:Bylaws#Section_5.4._Number">William was involved with</a>
                and tried to prevent,
                <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2024/04/10/SPI-associated-project.html">Gentoo is now with the SPI</a>
                due to failure to create and maintain a proper legal structure; after years of paying IRS taxes as a for
                profit company with donated money!
            </p>
            <p>
                This will NOT be the case with the legal Jacksonville Linux Users Group Inc. and why William L. Thomson Jr.
                sits atop the Board as Chairman of the Board with temporary veto powers to complete this process. Though,
                all that is to be formalized in <a href="https://github.com/JaxLUG/bylaws">draft bylaws</a> to be
                reviewed and adopted publicly and filed with the State of Florida. The Jacksonville Linux Users Group Inc.
                organization will be properly maintained during its entire 5-year probationary period to ensure permanent
                retention of 501(c)(3) status.
