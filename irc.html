  <h1>IRC Instructions: </h1>
  <hl>

    <p>The IRC is no longer hosted on Freenode (evidently Freenode suffered a hostile takeover in 2021 and most of the staff left). https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/freenode-irc-has-been-taken-over-by-the-crown-prince-of-korea/ </p>

    <p>It is now hosted on Libera.Chat #jaxlug</p>

    <p>So, fire up your IRC client of choice, look for the #jaxlug channel, and try out a nickname:
           /nick <your proposed nickname> (you can't use robmckennon... that's mine!)  :)

    <li>If successful, then register that nickname by:
        /msg NickServ REGISTER <Pas$w0rd> <yourEmail@blah.com> (for a confirmation email to be sent)

    <li>Copy the line in the email that looks like this:
        /msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER <nickname> </li>

    into the chat window, and you should see something like:

    <nickname> has now been verified.

That's it!
    </nickname>
