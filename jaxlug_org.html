                The Jacksonville Linux Users Group primary domain name from its inception in 1996 through 2023 was
                JaxLUG.org. This domain name has been lost. This page covers the story of how that happened. This page
                will be updated to fill in gaps in timeline as necessary, going through the past mailing list archive
                and emails keeps revealing long forgotten details.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are in the process of recovering this lost domain name!

                from Patrick Martin regarding JaxLUG.org domain name renewal in 2003 and, he
                <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=108619895008223&w=2">renewed it again</a> in 2004. This is
                for context as when you see the name Pat in subsequent email screenshots, you will have reference for
                who is Pat. For various reasons, past people were left on domain name records, respect, fail-safe, etc.

                Jumping to 2010, the domain was renewed through then, but started to exhibit issues as evident by this
                <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=127586748816602&w=2">message</a> from William L. Thomson Jr.,
                who was responsible at this time for many aspects of the unofficial JaxLUG but was not on the domain
                record, or managing DNS, despite running in-house DNS servers, that still exist to this day;
                ns1.obsidian-studios.com (GA), ns2.obsidian-studios.com (CA). Shortly after, there were issues with the
                wiki/website, which William offered to take over along with DNS as evident in this
                <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=127784790510733&w=2">message</a>

            <p>
                Fast forwarding to 2013, 2 years after William L. Thomson Jr. sent this
                <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=131068652222104&w=2">message</a> to the group
                announcing he would be stepping down from various roles with the JaxLUG. However, a little over two
                years later, William was still stuck running various services for the group because no one could take
                over all services; William wanted to hand over a VM with Wiki, mailing list, etc, not piecemeal. One
                day William was contacted by Jess Hires, who William was unfamiliar with, and was unaware had become the
                new unofficial leader of the unofficial JaxLUG.
            </p>
            <img src="images/jaxlug_org/email_w_jess_2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of William Email with Jess 2" height="360" style="float: left; padding: 0 1em 0 0;">
            <p>
                Now stop for a moment, you are a professional systems administrator, and someone you do not know emails
                you requesting access to a domain name record, and other services. Would you simply comply or verify?
            </p>
            <p>
                For an act of good faith, given the JaxLUG.org domain name was up for renewal, William requested anyone
                who was not on record, Jess Hires, or any other to simply renew the domain. Most any registrar will
                accept money from anyone to renew a domain name. William has done it for his clients, and the request
                to Jess and others was nothing out of the ordinary; especially, for a domain that didn't belong to
                anyone for an unofficial group with no legal existence or rights.
            </p>

            <p>
                William L. Thomson Jr. continued to renew the domain from 2011 to 2015, and finally in 2016, someone else
                renewed the domain and was added to the domain account. Then in 2017, the JaxLUG.org domain name was
                transferred to another registrar and managed by a consortium. William was no longer on record, received
                expiration, or other notifications, nor any past others like Dan McDougal (aka Riskable) and Patrick
                Martin, both of which were left on record by William, as stated initially, out of respect, fail-safe,
                etc. This tradition was broken in 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
                The names seen in screenshot such as Patrick Martin reflect that jaxlug.org primary owner was still
                Patrick as of 2017, with Dan McDougal (aka Riskable) also on file. All emails seen in the screenshot
                were sent to email address that William had direct access to, thus being able to produce the screenshot.
                Again, reflecting that the jaxlug.org domain record always contained multiple of those prior and current.

            <p>
                What happened after 2017, will have to be filled in at a later date and this section possible renamed.
                What is known is that as of 2021, the JaxLUG.org domain name was still owned and being used as evident
                by this DM on Discord between Dan Bidleman (inoi) and William L. Thomson Jr. (wltjr), where Dan was
                soliciting Williams help once again to perform various task for the unofficial JaxLUG that no others
                were willing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                William did not take up Dan's offer, despite being given access due to prior treatment from the
                unofficial group.

                The exact date is unknown, but as evident by the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) the JaxLUG.org 
                domain name was lost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230101000000*/jaxlug.org">sometime in 2023</a>.
                Unfortunately, the domain name currently points to some business and at times Visit Jacksonville website.

                The END! Or is it?

            <p>
                We are working to recover this lost domain, which will be a time consuming and expensive process, but
                can be done now that JaxLUG™ is owned IP by the Jacksonville Linux Users Group, Inc. a Florida
