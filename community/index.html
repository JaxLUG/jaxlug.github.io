                The past unofficial Jacksonville Linux Users Group has rich history of people spanning several decades
                with both newbies and old-timers with various community histories, and history must be learned from or
                it will be repeated. These pages are not intended to disparage nor praise anyone, they are simply
                presenting facts of people's conduct in the community, and the resulting impact upon the community from
                their conduct and actions, and at times, lack of action.

                The goal of the information is to improve the community, to improve community conduct, and prevent issues
                of the past from repeating, or simply, holding back future progress! This information does not confirm nor
                infer any membership in the official Legal Jacksonville Linux Users Group Inc. organization, simply that,
                these people were associated with the past unofficial Jacksonville Linux Users Group community at some
                point in the past and/or present.
