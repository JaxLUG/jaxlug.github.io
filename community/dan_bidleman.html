            <p>
                This aims to cover the history of Dan Bidleman in the past unofficial Jacksonville Linux Users
                Group community. There are people in this world who give off an impression of being highly skilled and
                experienced, but when it comes time for action, they fall short. Then, leaving a community in far worse
                shape than when you arrived, and still claiming to be part, to be some sort of "wheel" founder and
                member, yet abrogate in just about every responsibility of a steward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dan's actions are contrary to that of his appearance, and seriously brings Oracle into question! How can
                someone working for Oracle for 12 years and counting, rising in titles, currently being a Principle
                Software Engineer at Oracle corporation, lose a community domain name
                <a href="../jaxlug_org.html#2021">jaxlug.org</a>, first registered in 1996, then failing
                to host a LAMP stack, or move it to cloud hosted, GitHub, etc, failures in leadership, and other issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dan has a few monikers, Github handle  <a href="https://github.com/lisco42">lisco42</a>,
                Discord handle kip formerly inoi (265313310629429248), X handle
                <a href="https://x.com/lisco42">lisco42</a>,
                and for reference, Dan's LinkedIn 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-bidleman-69233214//">profile</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dan claims on his LinkedIn that "I am an exceptional linux administrator and engineer", this remains to
                be seen, and in fact, all public evidence, including
                <a href="https://kipiki.inoi.dev/">his own hosted website</a>, proves otherwise! This also brings into
                serious question Oracle, if Dan is not who he presents himself to be, then is Oracle the company it
                presents itself to be?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a work in progress as Dan's community actions and conduct continue, which Oracle has been 
                alerted to some 27 times over 2 months, Oracle is condoning Dan's destructive community conduct, and
                this page will be updated accordingly; time permitting. Oracle, is directly responsible for their
                employee's, Oracle's local representative, Linux community conduct, with Oracle being a Linux company.

            <p>
                Dan's is a Jacksonville, Florida native, who attended University of North Florida (UNF) from 2001 - 2006.
                Dan's interest were in computing, as evident by UNF Spinnaker
                <a href="https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=spinnaker">Volume 25, Number 21</a>
                from February 13th, 2002. It has been stated by Dan that he switched majors to Philosophy from computing,
                which cannot be verified, but philosophy major can be confirmed in UNF Spinnaker
                <a href="https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1528&context=spinnaker">Volume 28, Number 20</a>
                from February 13th, 2002, where Dan is quoted as a senior philosophy major and founder of the Computer
                Gaming Club at UNF -- and head honcho! Dan has long boasted about such, which is evident in the article,
                "Marf-LAN sponsored by Computer Gaming Club". This is finally confirmed by
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/nathan-nye-a3407b136">Dan's LinkedIn profile</a>,
                where he states that he was a student at UNF from 2001 - 2006, having been awarded a Bachelors Degree in
                Philosophy from UNF in 2006; where it also mentions his past with computer gaming club.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can be established that Dan has both an interesting on gaming and computing, but it does seem
                primarily gaming focused; Dan could have started any computing club. The "head honcho" part is 
                interesting, it implies a desire for positions of power and titles; hubris vs humbleness. Unless,
                one assumes the writer just added such colorful descriptive verbiage.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <p>
                Given there are no rosters or way of tracking in the past unofficial Jacksonville Linux Users Group it
                is hard to determine the exact date when Dan showed up, but the first publicly confirmable
                record is when he sent <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=122142797829144&w=2">this reply</a>
                to a post on the mailing list on September 10th, 2008; ironic mentioning UNF's ITS helpdesk. There is
                one <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=122835330505063&w=2">other reply</a> on November 29th, 2008,
                which another member William L. Thomson Jr. also
                <a href="https://marc.info/?l=jaxlug-list&m=122841959827712&w=2">sent a reply</a> on the same thread.
            </p>
            <p>
                This establishes Dan showing up sometime in 2008. It would not be until 2013 that Dan would first present,
                which per the poorly maintained <a href="../history.html#2021">meeting history page</a> occurred on
                October 16th, 2013.

                Per Dan's LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-bidleman-69233214//">profile</a>, he was a
                System Engineer IV at FSCJ from 2009 to 2014. What is not mentioned on there is that Dan also taught
                a Linux course at FSCJ; which appears to be
                <a href="https://catalog.fscj.edu/courses/1060721">CNT 1015C</a> - Operating Systems Foundations. The
                exact course name and topic can not be confirmed, but
                <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/1493650">online ratings</a> of Professor Dan exist from
                2011 and 2013, confirming him teaching at FSCJ. Why this is missing from his LinkedIn is unknown.

                his employment with Oracle in 2014 with the titles of IT Senior Consultant and Principle System

                unrecorded results. This positions has been referred to by legal titles such as "President", but the
                group has not had a legal presence since 2004. This appears to be when Dan first undertook the
                unofficial leadership role which he was honored by per

                It is unknown what happened in the years between, "elections" resumed per

                some attempt at legit elections!
            </p>
            <p>
                2023 appears to be the last year of Dan's leadership. It was also in 2023 that the

            <p>
                In 2017, William transferred the JaxLUG.org domain name to Dan. This transfer was done with full
                confidence that Dan would be a proper steward, given his employment at Oracle a Systems Administrator,
                and his claimed abilities. This was pre-promotion in 2019 to Software Engineer at Oracle.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no way an Oracle employee, an Oracle engineer, an Oracle systems administrator, could possible
                lose a community domain name. This was the basis for the transfer, Dan was reliable per being an Oracle
                employee, based on Oracle's reputation. This was a mistake!
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2023, the JaxLUG.org domain name was <a href="../jaxlug_org.html#2021">lost</a>!

                simply seek to for Oracle to pay for their employee's mistake that has cost the Linux community in

                In April 2020, Dan unilaterally created a Discord server without discussion. In his defense, this was

                It appears in September 2025, after having Dinner with William, it seems Dan transferred the ownership
                of the Discord server to <a href="christian_mclaughlin.html#discord">Christian McLaughlin</a>. The
                exact date when Dan transferred the discord server is unknown, and may have been to another before
                Christian, and/or done to Christian sometime before September 2025; as of September 2025 Christian was
                the discord server owner of the server Dan created.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, Dan created the discord, and therefore, as a leader and steward, is responsible for that
                which he created, no matter his role, long as he remains in the community, which he remains active in
                that Discord throughout all of 2025 up till the very end!
            </p>
            <p>
                We do request ownership transfer of the Discord server to the Official Legal Jacksonville Linux Users
                Group Inc. or the server be deleted, and that Dan help facilitate this request given the server is his
                creation and he transferred ownership to abrogate his responsibilities; a futile attempt to
                indemnify himself from the results of his own creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oracle has been informed of this request, we simply seek compliance vs resistance from Dan!

            <p>
                In 2021, it seems Dan may have been seeking to encourage another,
                <a href="christian_mclaughlin.html#discord">Christian McLaughlin</a> to perform a "leadership" role in
                the group. William L. Thomson, was working to get the unofficial Jacksonville Linux Users group meeting
                space at FSCJ via one of William's contacts,
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernie-friend-63701813/">Ernie Friend</a>;
                who has since departed FSCJ. William was unfamiliar with Christian, William did not want to risk his 
                reputation with FSCJ on Christian which seems William was correct on, and therefore, involving Dan in
                communications with FSCJ and not Christian. Dan failed to proceed beyond the shown message.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dan never followed up with Enrie Friend nor FSCJ, and as a result, meetings were not held there, and
                meeting space continued to be an issue into Fall 2025, which was one of my calls to action for William!
                Had Dan simply replied, things were setup, William had already done the work, all Dan need to do was
                follow through. Dan was pre-occupied with other things, as was William working on his Undergrad in
                Computer Science at UNF; William was extremely short on time, but made time to help the community!

                This section will be completed at a later date, as we further establish Dan's relationship to the
                B-Sides Jax conference. What is known is that amazingly, the very day Oracle was first alerted on
                November 6th, 2025, that very day
                <a href="https://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/GetDocument?aggregateId=domnp-n24000010319-7ed34002-522b-4599-bb9f-52ee3b5bea70&transactionId=n24000010319-7fd4d5d6-73cd-4ca8-8067-bc0d6e9dbd8f&formatType=PDF">Dan is removed as Secretary</a>

                which typically take days to process per the published
                <a href="https://dos.fl.gov/sunbiz/document-processing-dates/">document processing dates</a>; the
                chance that paperwork sent prior was processed same day, with sponsors contacted the day prior on
                November 5th, 2025, this is an unbelievable coincidence!

            <h2 id="betrayal">Betrayal</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                On September 13th, 2025, William L. Thomson Jr. had Dan over for dinner, he invited Dan into his home
                and William cooked dinner. They discussed many things, as William was taking time away from masters course
                research work. Toward the end, as Dan was departing, William had discussed some future theoretical plans
                for the Jacksonville Linux Users Group come 2026. Rather than support William in his efforts, it appears
                Dan has chosen betrayal. He alerted others, became defensive over his involvement with B-Sides, which
                William did not understand at that time, given how Dan spoke poorly of others for years, yet remains
                associated with them, which was shocking to William; until betrayal, then it became clear that is how
                Dan operates, as Dan likely had spoken poorly of William to others just as he did to William.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than support, Dan chose opposition, chose to take time and make life more difficult for a person
                he has known for years, former gym work-out-partner, among social interactions, while they are in their
                final semester of a masters degree, with very limited time. What William mistook as a friendly request
                for dinner from Dan, was a spy mission. While William had no grand plans at the time, the course of
                actions from others have compelled William to act in ways he was not planning and much sooner!
            </p>
            <p>
                William made it quite clear to Dan that others would seek to act against him, and rather than Dan
                perform any role of leadership or stewardship, it seems he transferred the ownership of the Discord server
                to <a href="christian_mclaughlin.html#discord">Christian McLaughlin</a>, who proceeded to silence and
                then ban William, exactly as William had told Dan in-person the day before that others would seek to do!
                Dan had advanced warning, ability to influence things otherwise, and Dan chose the path of most resistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                William is quite blown away at Dan's conduct, between hindering his education, to interference with
                efforts to advance education for others, and various benefits to the community, but ones that may cost
                Dan his position in the community, and for that, Dan showed his true colors. For Dan, community service
                is for Dan, not for the community, it is self-serving, ego-driven, agenda-based on titles such as, head
                honcho, president, etc. It is not the titles that matter, it is the actions!
            </p>
            </p>
                Dan <a href="../jaxlug_org.html#2021">lost jaxlug.org</a> among many other things, all while working at
                Oracle, which all reflects back on Oracle, as their employee's community conduct. This speaks to the
                quality and skills of both Dan and Oracle! Real or not is for readers to decide.
            </p>
            </p>
                Dan appeared to be many things he is not!
