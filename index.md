## Jacksonville Linux Users' Group (JaxLUG)
The **_Jacksonville Linux Users' Group_** or **_JaxLUG_** is a diverse
assembly of Linux users (beginners, casual desktop users, system
administrators, developers, and IT professionals) that have a passion for
supporting [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and
[Free Open Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
and live in or around
[Jacksonville, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville)
metropolitan area. The JaxLUG, originally started by Daniel Stringfield in
1996, is led by [Officers](https://www.jaxlug.net/index.php/Officers),
who are elected annually.

To get to know us and become a member of the JaxLUG, please join our
Mailing List and attend our Monthly Meetings. We also have a IRC channel
#jaxlug @ freenode.net for real time access to JaxLUG members. 

### JaxLUG Meetings
The JaxLUG meets every **3rd Wednesday** of the month. The meeting begins
with social **intermingling at 6:30PM** and
**presentations start at 7:00 PM**. JaxLUG meeting presenters and topics
vary, for more information take a look at our
**Past [Meeting History](https://www.jaxlug.net/index.php/Meeting_History)**.
JaxLUG meetings usually end with several members traveling to a local
restaurant for a LUSH (Linux Users Social Hour).

#### Be the presenter at a meeting

is welcome to be a presenter at any meeting. With a topic of their choosing,
