            <p>
                The Jacksonville Linux Users Group primary domain name from its inception in 1996 through 2023 was
                JaxLUG.org. This domain name has been lost. This page covers the ongoing efforts to recovering the lost
                JaxLUG.org domain name. Another page covers,
                <a href="jaxlug_org.html">The Story of How JaxLUG.org was lost</a>.
                This page will be updated anytime actions are taken.
            </p>
            <h2 id="initial">Initial Notice</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Initial notice was sent on 9/24/2025 to <a href="mailto:abuse@porkbun.com">Porkbun Abuse</a> and an
                automated reply was received informing that Porkbun has transitioned to an
                <a href="https://porkbun.com/abuse">online abuse reporting process</a> and does not have a process to
                handle <a href="https://abuse.cleandns.space/porkbun/trademark">trademark abuse</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using Porkbun's Whois tool, the current owner of JaxLUG.org was looked up and an email was sent via
                Porkbun's WHOIS Contact Form on 9/24/2025 to alert the owner of Trademark infringement and that the
                Jacksonville Linux Users Group would like its old domain name, JaxLUG.org back, and would be willing to
                cover any current registration and renewal costs along with domain escrow.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not know if the email sent via Porkbun's system was received and/or read, unless we receive some
                sort of reply, Porkbun does not provide any means to track emails sent.
            </p>
            <h2 id="legal">Legal Options</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Regardless of cooperation from the current JaxLUG.org domain name owner, there are two options available
                for legal remedies,
                <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/contracted-parties/registry-operators/services/rights-protection-mechanisms-and-dispute-resolution-procedures/urs">Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS)</a>
                and
                <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/contracted-parties/consensus-policies/uniform-domain-name-dispute-resolution-policy/uniform-domain-name-dispute-resolution-policy-01-01-2020-en">Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (URDP)</a>.
                While the former URS is cheaper and faster, it only takes down content, it does not impact the domain
                name owner, and does not result transfer of domain name ownership. The latter URDP is more costly,
                but it does ensure the domain name is transferred upon a successful filing. The World Intellectual
                Property Organization (WIPO) has a nice
                <a href="https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/guide/">URDP guide</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The URDP criteria is easily met:
                <ul>
                    <li>The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to their trademark.</li>
                    <li>The domain owner has no legitimate rights or interests in the name.</li>
                    <li>The domain was registered and used in bad faith.</li>
                </ul>
                The current owner of JaxLUG.org violates each one of those!
            </p>
            <p>
                The URDP process is best done through an entity that can oversee and manage the process, and it has
                various fees depending on the number of panelist. Fees for a single panelist on one to five domains
                starts at <a href="https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/fees/">$1500 USD per WIPO</a>. We have found
                two alternative sources that are a bit cheaper. One with Forum, an American company based out of
                Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Forum charges
                <a href="https://www.adrforum.com/assets/resources/domain/udrp/UDRP%20Fee%20Schedule%20Final.pdf">$1330 for a URDP case</a>
                single-member panel one to two domain names, double for a two-member panel. There is another that
                seems to be the cheapest option, the Czech Arbitration Court's filing fees are
                <a href="https://udrp.adr.eu/fees">$800 Euros</a>, single-member panel one to five domain names, but is
                handled outside of the USA and could incur additional costs. Additional information on URDP costs can
                be found <a href="https://giga.law/blog/2019/2/27/what-it-costs-to-file-a-udrp-complaint">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this time, we have not chosen the route, though most likely we will go with the Forum. However, we
                are hopeful that the current domain name owner will do the right thing. We have considered offering a 
                bounty or reward, given the costs of the URDP process, money will be spent one way or another; though
                this could also be seen as extortion from the current domain name owner. We may also elect to do a fund
                raising campaign to help the JaxLUG recover its lost JaxLUG.org domain name!
